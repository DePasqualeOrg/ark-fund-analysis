# ARK Fund Analysis

This project downloads the data that ARK Invest publishes on its actively managed ETFs and presents an analysis of that data over time in the form of a Jupyter notebook (see example [here](https://a-dpq.github.io/ark-fund-analysis/)).

### Installation and Usage

Run `install.sh` to install the necessary Python libraries, and follow the directions shown for completing `config.json`. Then run the notebook or set up a cron job for one of the automation scripts. Example cron entries are provided in the comment at the top of `cron_update_data.py` (for downloading new data) and `cron_export_notebook.py` (for downloading new data and exporting the notebook).

This repository does not include historical data. Some historical data is available in the commit history [here](https://github.com/tigger0jk/ark-invest-scraper).
